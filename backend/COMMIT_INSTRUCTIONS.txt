Run these commands in the `backend` folder to commit and push the dependency fix:

cd backend
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: ensure @types/node installed during Render build"
git push origin main

After push, check Render dashboard for automatic redeploy and watch the build logs.
